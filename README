My authentication library. WIP.

Using With Pylons
=================

Add as a dependency.


In your config/environment.py

  import jgauth.model

  ...

  init_model(engine)
  jgauth.model.init_model(engine)


This will make the model in jgauth part of your model in a web request.


In you websetup.py:

@@ -3,6 +3,7 @@ import logging
 
   import jgauth.model.meta as jgauth_meta
    
      
   # Create the tables if they don't already exist
   Base.metadata.create_all(bind=Session.bind)
   jgauth_meta.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=Session.bind)

This will cause the tables to be created as part of the setup process.


In your lib/base.py:

    import jgauth.pylons


    class BaseController(WSGIController):

        def __before__(self):
            jgauth.pylons.__before__()

This will cause the c.user to be set for every request.


You can call the methods in jgauth.pylons to login, logout, register, etc...
Note that it is assumed you have certain controllers in a certain way. I'll
have to figure out a way to get that added.


"Forgot your password" coming soon.
